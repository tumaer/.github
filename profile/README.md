## ðŸ‘‹ Hi

Welcome to the organizational repository of the [Chair of Aerodynamics and Fluid Mechanics](https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/en/aer/home/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). Our work centers around computational fluid dynamics, the creation of novel solvers, the development of new numerical algorithms, and the utilization of data-driven paradigms such as machine learning to that purpose led by [Professor Nikolaus A. Adams](https://www.epc.ed.tum.de/en/aer/members/cv/prof-adams/).

### Developed Numerical Solvers

* [jax-fluids](https://github.com/tumaer/jaxfluids), a fully-differentiable CFD solver for 3D, compressible two-phase flows written entirely in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).
* [ALPACA](https://github.com/tumaer/ALPACA), an MPI-parallelized C++ simulator for compressible multiphase flow physics using advanced high-resolution sharp-interface modeling empowered by multiresolution compression.
